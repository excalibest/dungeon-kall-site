      <h2>Is this beginner friendly?</h2>
      <p>
        Absolutely! Most of the players I work with are trying tabletop RPGs for the
        first time. I spent over a year running walk‑in games at a local game
        store, so I’m very comfortable guiding newcomers through the rules and
        ensuring everyone has fun.
      </p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Where do sessions take place?</h2>
      <p>
        Sessions are typically hosted in the client’s home, but I’m happy to meet
        at a neutral venue like a library room or local game store. We’ll pick
        whatever space makes your group most comfortable.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing except your enthusiasm! I provide miniatures, lights, speakers,
        books, pencils, character sheets and dice. If you have favourite dice or
        props you’d like to use, feel free to bring them along.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Do you help with character creation?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. For campaigns we hold a free Session 0 to create characters
        together. I can also supply pre‑generated characters tailored to your
        group’s preferences. Some systems have great online tools we can use to
        speed things along.
      </p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>How do I schedule and pay?</h2>
      <p>
        The easiest way is to use the Calendly link on the Schedule page. You can
        also contact me via email. Payment can be made through any mainstream
        digital service (PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, etc.) or by cash/check at the
        session.
      </p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>What’s your cancellation policy?</h2>
      <p>
        Cancellations are free up to three days before your session. If you
        cancel within 24 hours without a good reason, you’re eligible for a
        50% refund. Emergencies and extenuating circumstances are always fully
        refunded – no questions asked.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Do you run online sessions?</h2>
      <p>
        I currently specialise in in‑person games, but I’m open to online
        sessions depending on the inquiry. Feel free to ask.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Do you offer long‑term campaigns?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! I love developing long‑running stories. For weekly, bi‑weekly or
        monthly campaigns, please email me to discuss scheduling and pricing.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>What systems do you run?</h2>
      <p>
        I currently run Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5E and 2024, Pathfinder 2E
        Remastered, Electric Bastionland and Mythic Bastionland. I can learn or
        relearn Blades in the Dark, Mouse Ritter or Panic at the Dojo quickly,
        and I’m willing to explore Starfinder, Call of Cthulhu, Fabula Ultima,
        Daggerheart, Cyberpunk and more on request.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Do you provide official modules?</h2>
      <p>
        Most of my campaigns are home‑brew adventures crafted for your group, but
        I’m happy to run published modules if there’s a specific story you’d like
        to play.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Are sessions suitable for children or families?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. I tailor sessions to suit groups of any age. Participants under 18
        must have a parent or legal guardian’s permission to play. For children
        under 13, a parent or guardian is required to be present at the table,
        ideally as part of the group. This helps ensure everyone has a safe and
        enjoyable experience.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>What safety and conduct guidelines do you have at the table?</h2>
      <p>
        Creating a respectful, inclusive environment is a top priority. Before
        every session we review “Lines and Veils” – discussing content you want
        to keep off‑limits or fade to black – and agree on a safety word like
        “button” that anyone can use to pause or adjust the scene. This
        conversation can also take place over email prior to the session.
      </p>
      <p>During play I ask everyone to observe a few simple guidelines:</p>
      <ul style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Respect your fellow players and the game world; no harassment,
          discrimination or bullying.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of the comfort levels of others. Avoid graphic or
          potentially triggering content unless the group has agreed it’s okay.</li>
        <li>Keep table talk focused; give everyone a chance to speak and
          participate.</li>
        <li>Maintain confidentiality. Stories shared at the table stay at the
          table unless everyone agrees otherwise.</li>
        <li>Follow all house rules and local laws regarding behaviour,
          substances and appropriateness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If something makes you uncomfortable during play, you can say the safety
        word or speak to me privately at any time. I’ll pause and adjust the
        scene to make sure everyone feels safe and heard.
