      <h2>The Stamp Heist (Electric Bastionland)</h2>
      <p>
        In one unforgettable one‑shot, a ragtag team found themselves £10,000 in
        debt to the Stamp Appreciation Society. With no time to spare, they hatched
        a plan to steal a collection of ultra‑rare stamps displayed at a gala
        hosted by Lady Gazelle – a literal gazelle and stamp tycoon. The party
        included a lawyer, a washed‑up college jock, an unsuccessful dog breeder
        and a family of six siblings spanning multiple timelines. Armed with
        makeshift weapons, exploding cigars and a surprising amount of
        improvisation, they infiltrated the party, battled sentient coins and
        ninjas, and ultimately made off with the coveted Midnight Noir stamp. The
        mission was chaotic, hilarious and completely improvised – a testament
        to how much fun you can have with an open mind and good company.

      <h2>The Fall of Bhaal (Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5E)</h2>
      <p>
        In a long‑running D&amp;D campaign, my players faced Bhaal – the god of
        murder – after he absorbed his brothers and built a world‑spanning cult.
        The final confrontation lasted only 54 seconds in‑game, but the table
        exploded with tension and excitement as heroes unleashed their
        abilities. It remains one of my most satisfying finales and an example
        of how climactic combat can deliver a truly epic payoff.
